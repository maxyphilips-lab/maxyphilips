### 1. Supply Chain Performance Audit (R & Tableau)
### Goal
To diagnose the true root causes of high delivery risk and shipping costs.
### Key Insight
Created a Cost vs. Reliability Trade-off model that demonstrated all supplier tiers were clustered in the "High Cost, High Risk" danger zone. This proved the problem was systemic (traffic/port congestion), not supplier-specific. This required a fix to the KPI definition to accurately measure On-Time Rate.
### Deliverable
Identification of the single highest-leverage variable for future optimization investment.
